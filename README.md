# Movie_Recommender_system

`Introduction`
- This is my trial at a project exercise during a <a href = https://github.com/Pierian-Data> Pierian Data Inc. </a> Bootcamp. 
- The goal was to create a simple movie recommender system based on the item-item similarity collaborative filtering technique developed by <a href= https://www.amazon.science/the-history-of-amazons-recommendation-algorithm> Amazon </a>. 
- The dataset used is the famous <a href = https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/> MovieLens dataset</a>, commonly used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.
- The work is far from deployable, but the process sufficiently provided movie recommendations based on similarities in how users rate the movies.

## Installations

The only package required to run the code is the Anaconda Distribution of Python. Any Python versions above 3.0 should work.  



## File Descriptions

Apart from this ReadMe Markdown, there are 3 items in the repo that really matter to us. The Movie_Lens_Recommender notebook showcase the steps for creating our recommender system. Other files contain the datasets I used. I included the data here because of the relatively small size. 
In the `.ipynb`, Markdown cells were used to explain the thought-process behind each step. 


## How-to-

With the required installation, it's as simple as following the steps described in the notebook
